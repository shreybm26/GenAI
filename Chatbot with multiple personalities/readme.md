This is an ongoing project that is still under development, with some bugs remaining to be fixed before it is fully functional. The goal of this project is to create a chatbot that can respond to users based on a selected personality from a set of predefined options. The chatbot's responses are driven by a dataset specifically curated with prompts and replies aligned with various personality types, enabling the model to deliver contextually appropriate interactions.

The model has been fine-tuned using Hugging Face's tools to ensure that it accurately reflects the distinct characteristics of each personality. For the front-end, Streamlit has been utilized to create a user-friendly interface. Once completed, this project aims to provide a versatile and engaging conversational experience tailored to individual user preferences.
