This repository contains a collection of projects that Iâ€™ve developed, primarily leveraging Google's Gemini API. Each project is accompanied by a requirements.txt file, which lists the dependencies needed to run the main code. The requirements.txt is generally consistent across the different Python scripts, ensuring that all necessary libraries are readily available for each project.
