# Projects Leveraging Google's Gemini API

Welcome to my repository, where you'll find a series of innovative projects centered around Google's Gemini API. These projects demonstrate practical applications of the API, showcasing how it can be used to solve real-world problems with machine learning and data analysis.

Each project in this repository is self-contained, complete with a `requirements.txt` file that specifies all the necessary dependencies. This ensures that you can easily set up the environment and run the code without worrying about missing libraries. The `requirements.txt` files are generally consistent across the projects, making it straightforward to manage dependencies.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shreybm26/GenAI.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd project-directory
   
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the project:
   ```bash
   python [filename].py
